# Using Bumper with Sucks

At this time you'll need to use the bmartin5692 fork of sucks.  Especially if you have a newer bot like an Ozmo.

- Download and install [Sucks](https://github.com/bmartin5692/sucks)

- You can use Sucks CLI to control the bots

**Note:** When performing the login command you'll either want to set `verify_ssl` to `False` or provide the full path to your Bumper certificate.

OR

- You can use Sucks as a library from your own script, see the [example script](../examples/sucks.py)
